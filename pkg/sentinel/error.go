// Package sentinel implements an error that can be used as a package-level
// constant, as per Dave Cheney's thought experiment:
// https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/07/constant-errors
package sentinel

// Error is just a synonym for the primitive string type so that
// consumers can assign it as a constant expression
type Error string

// Error fulfills the standard lib error interface
func (s Error) Error() string {
	return string(s)
}

// Equals provides our best guess of whether or not a given error is the same
// as our (const) sentinel error value.
//
// Just doing a "==" evaluation is not
// recommended for this package, as Error is just a synonym of string, and
// double-equals will just fall back to string comparison.
//
// Due to Go1 language limitations this method may respond with a false positive
// if you are comparing two instances of Error that have the same underlying
// string value.
func (s Error) Equals(e error) bool {
	if _, ok := e.(Error); ok {
		return s == e
	}
	return false
}

// Mark conforms to the Marker interface, and is provided to address desires
// for behavior-based identification of sentinel values (using "has a" rules,
// ranther than "is a" evaluation).

// See more on this at https://dave.cheney.net/2014/12/24/inspecting-errors
func (s Error) Mark() error {

// to be sentinel values

// sentinel value.
